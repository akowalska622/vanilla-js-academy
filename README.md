#Vanilla JS Academy

**Vanilla JS Academy** is a project-based course from Chris Ferdinandi. The code used in projects is 100% mine and it's only my work and effort, Chris provides only 2-3 minutes theoretical lessons, but projects **aren't** made in code-along way.

Feel free to explore code of the projects or visit [this page](https://akowalska622.github.io/vanilla-js-academy/) to see demos. Enjoy!
